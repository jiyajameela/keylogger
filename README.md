# keylogger

#A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that records the keystrokes typed on a keyboard. It can capture everything a user types, including passwords, messages, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. While keyloggers can have legitimate uses, such as monitoring children's internet activity or troubleshooting technical issues, they are often associated with malicious intent when used without the user's knowledge or consent. The keylogger i made is just a basic form of keylogger, unlike the ones that are available today.
